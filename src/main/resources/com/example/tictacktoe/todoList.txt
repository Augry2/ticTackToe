1. add test for valid clicks

    - test for whose turn it is
    - player position test
    -

    -------- come back to this, making tests for controller seems like bad idea --------
    . in the controller we could test if the correct element in avaliable buttons is set to true
    . or check if the button has been disabled, perhaps both

    getter for buttonsclicked, then make a method in model that checks if a button has been clicked or not


2. add test for if the round has been finished (String winner in model class contains the winner in string, maybe use this)
    - test that proves that player can win
    - test that proves that computer can win
    - test that proves that it can be a tie
